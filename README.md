### Hi!

My name is Lawrence Zhao and I'm first-year student at Yale. I am particularly interested in the intersections between science, art, and computing.

## Sample Projects
- ðŸ”­ [**Shukla Group**](https://shuklagroup.org/research/) @UIUC. I designed, ran, and analyzed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on a remote server to study the binding process of endocannabinoids to the human CB1/CB2 receptors. Wrote scripts in Python and Bash. 

- ðŸŒ± [**Coolstem**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGpzTcLjZJlD6EzIDlgltMw). I develop fascinating science outreach activities for elementary/middle school students. These videos were produced and edited using Adobe Premiere and After Effects. I also created animations in Python by using the Manim framework. 

- ðŸ”¢ [**Lean Theorem Prover**](https://github.com/vaibhavkarve/leanteach2020). Over the summer of 2020, I worked with Vaibhav Karve and three other high school students to formalize geometry in the Lean theorem prover language.
