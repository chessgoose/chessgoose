### Hi!

My name is Lawrence Zhao and I'm a first-year student at Yale. I am particularly interested in the intersections between science, art, and computing.

## Sample Projects
- 🔭 [**Shukla Group**](https://shuklagroup.org/research/) @UIUC. I designed, ran, and analyzed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study the binding process of endocannabinoids to the human CB1/CB2 receptors. Mostly written in Python and Bash. 

- 🌱 [**Coolstem**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGpzTcLjZJlD6EzIDlgltMw). I develop fascinating science outreach activities for elementary/middle school students. These videos were produced and edited using Adobe Premiere and After Effects. I also created explanatory math animations in Python with [Manim](https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim). 

- 🔢 [**LeanTeach**](https://github.com/vaibhavkarve/leanteach2020). Over the summer of 2020, I worked with Vaibhav Karve and three other high school students to formalize geometry in the Lean theorem prover.
